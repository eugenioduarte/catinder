# Cat Tinder Challenge

A React Native/Expo challenge inspired by Tinder, but for cats! The goal is to practice swipe gestures, animations, API integration, internationalization, and modern architecture best practices.

## About the project

### Main features

- Animated swipe cards for cats
- Voting (like/dislike) via swipe or buttons
- TheCatAPI integration
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Snackbar for error feedback
- Custom typography and theme
- Modular and scalable structure
